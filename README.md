# Xenon Gaming RP v3
This is for the most part a rewrite of my old Xenon Gaming script, which looking back at now, was awful code wise. This version will use better methods for pretty much everything, using methods I've learnt over the years. One thing I'll be making use of is cache saving, mostly for the login stage (so data only needs to be looked up once, when the player connects).
